### Research Interests

My research interests can be roughly divided into two categories. One is about **stochastic differential games** and **mean field games**, together with related topics of **applied probability**, **stochastic analysis**, and **partial differential equations**. The other is machine learning, especially **generative models**, **transfer learning** and **(inverse reinforcement) learning**. A majority of the problems in the above areas arise from the fields of **finance**, **economics** and **operations research** and it is equally fascinating to see how the analytical and computational tools can help solve practical problems in these fields.
