**In the coming Spring semester of 2024, I will be teaching a newly approved course at Master/PhD level.**

- **EN.553.640 Machine Learning in Finance**

My past experiences as teaching assistant at UC Berkeley cover undergraduate to PhD level probability and stochastic processes, including topics such as random variables, Markov chain, Poisson process, renewal process, martingale, Brownian motion, It√¥ calculus, etc. I am also interested in offering courses in financial engineering, simulation and machine learning.
