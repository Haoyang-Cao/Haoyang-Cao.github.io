I was a postdoctoral researcher at <strong>Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées (CMAP)</strong>, <strong>École Polytechnique</strong> from January 2022 to December 2023 under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Mathieu Rosenbaum</strong>. Before joining CMAP, I was a Machine Learning in Finance Research Associate at the <strong>Alan Turing Institute</strong> in London under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Samuel N. Cohen</strong> and <strong>Prof. Lukasz Szpruch</strong> from September 2020 to December 2021. During my stay in the UK, I have also been a visiting scholar at the <strong>Mathematical Institute at University of Oxford</strong> hosted by <strong>Prof. Rama Cont</strong> and Prof. Cohen. I completed my PhD study in 2020 under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Xin Guo</strong> in the <strong>Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research</strong> at the <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong>. Prior to my PhD study, I received my Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the <strong>University of Hong Kong</strong> in 2015. </p>
